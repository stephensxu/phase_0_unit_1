## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

* Initially the setting up GitHub part was relatively intuitive for me. The set-up process have opened my eyes about Git and Gighub and immediatly I understood the power that's behind these two important tools: collaboration and source sharing between engineers. 

* Difference between Git and Github:
- Git is a software that allows user to keep a copy of original version of their files before making changes, and creating a stack of copies of different versions of the file. This function allows user to jump back-and-forth between different version of the file.
- GitHub is a remote website that allows user to share their Git folders on the Web; therefore allowing user to access files from different locations/devices, also allowing different user to contribute to the same project while giving them access to all versions of the file, both locally and remotely.

* Version control is the process of keeping a file version before making changes; then make the change and having free access to both modified and unmodified versions of the files. GitHub helps by giving user space to store all these different versions online, so user can access from any location/device and multiple user can contribute to the same file/project.

* Developers user version control so they are free to make modification to their files while not having to worry about losing the original version. It makes perfect sense to me, because softwares require constant update to keep up with changes; and it is essential to keep all the older version available, in case the changes have unintended consequences or other people would like to look at older versions.

* I think everything I've encountered so far makes perfect sense to me.
