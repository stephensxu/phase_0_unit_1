* Most things I've learned about HTML makes sense to me so far. The only part I couldn't understand is that why do we have to keep typing beginning tags and ending tages consistently? If all tages are ment to be closed, shouldn't there be a much shorter way to achieve this?

* The best thing about HTML is that it allows user to input contents relatively easy while the browser can easily understand what the user is trying a express. The bad thing about HTML is that the syntax of this language is still relatively different from what human use on a day-to-day base(such as formating with word document).

* Yes, when I learned about how CSS be linked to HTML documents, I finally fully understood how exactly external CSS files serve the purpose of styling different contents in the HTML files.

* Websites that allow instant result for combination of CSS, HTML and JavaScript:
