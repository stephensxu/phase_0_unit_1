* To creating repository on GitHub; go to the home page, on the upper-right hand corner click the "+" sign, then click on "New Repository". At the creation page, type in the desired name for the repository and click "Create repository" at bottom of the page. Once that's done; oppen up Github app, find the name of the newly created repository and click "clone to computer" tab.

* Open source means that the source code created by a certain developer is being shared freely on the internet for other developers' access.

* I believe open source is one of the greatest ways that have been invented by human kind to encourage collaboration and drives innovation. It makes me both nervous and protective. Alghough open source has many benefits; one concerning factor is that it can only exist in an environment where people respect copy rights and licensing rights and there are laws protecting this right. It is important to ensure that the contributor to open source projects are fairly credited and compensated in some case.

* The importance of using licenses is the make sure developers of open source projects are credited, and make sure open source projects are shared freely by other parties as well.

* I found that I can use the Github app to graphically control git instead of the terminal tools.

* What is open source?
