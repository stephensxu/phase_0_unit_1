Hi Guys,

My name is Stephens Xu and I live in San Jose, CA.  

Iâ€™m graduated from UC Berkeley with economics/finance and worked in sales & trading field for three years. Now my desire to be a builder and passion for technology lead me to DBC.

My favorite sites are www.google.com, www.blueapron.com, www.techcrunch.com

My thinking style is Abstract Random. My learning style is Kinethsetic.

Here are the links to my week 1 stuff per the instructions

Let me know if you have questions!

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.
