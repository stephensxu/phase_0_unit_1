Blog url: http://stephensxu.github.io/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I did enjoy very much the process of writting the blog post. I am always amazed by the different type of elegant contents on the internet and has have something to say about them. The blog give me an opportunity to describe 3 of my favorites web real-estate. As a beginner web-developer, I believe it is essential that we look at good projects and try to learn, and possible reverse-engineer the site. Also this is the very first website I ever made for myself, so the process of combining HTML and CSS in real practice really gave me good practice and understanding about the technology. I tried to be short and concise on my blogs, because personally I believe simplicty is one of the most important factor for websites to be user-friendly.
