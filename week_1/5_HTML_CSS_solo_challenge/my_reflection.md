* Most of my questions are asking what exactly does the Box Model mean and how the different method of positioning works. The most useful resources I found are the CSS sample codes on www.w3schoos.com/css/css_examples.asp

* I was having a lot of trouble with the concept of how to float text on top of image. I spent lot of time researching online and finally found out that the key to solving this challenge is to position the text in absolute position and assiging a higher z-index to the text than the image; if they overlap in their position then the text would be placed on top of image.

* I have learned may new skills and tricks; most significantly I have learned how to position my contents using CSS and how to wrap html contents in different layers.

* I enjoyed the part where I can use different colors to wrap around my html contents.

* The challenge of having to make div that contains an image and cpation and position the caption absolutely overtop the image is the part I found tedious.
