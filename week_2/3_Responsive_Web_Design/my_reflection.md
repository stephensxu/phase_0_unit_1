# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
- A: Responsive web design is the idea that the web disign should be flexible in a way that it can be very accessable by different devices, different browsers and on different size of screen. I like it and think it is good practice. One of the fundamental reason for the existence of internet is to make information free and shared by everyone in the world. The more audience we can reach, the better. Our web design should take many things into consideration, such as screen size, browser support and people with disability. It is good practice, required by the law and the right thing to do.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
- A: I think smartphones and tablets have made web designers to rethink about their strategy; especially given the current trend that users are actually spending more time with their mobile devices, less time on PC. In developing contury such as China, some first-time internet users even skipped the PC era and went directly to mobile device, making they cell-phone their main channel to access the internet. With this trend, responsive design became increasingly important as we have to always have mobile presense in mind.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
- A: Visually impaired people use sound to access information on the Web. They can definitly do it; there are tool such as Apple's VoiceOver tool which reads out the web content loudly. We should definitly design and develop for visually imparired people; it is required by the law and the right thing to do. It is our responsibility to make our web content as accessble as possible.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
- A: The idea of making information as accessble as possible have really resonated with me. One important reason I wanted to be a software developer is that I would like to make a small difference in the world we live in; I would like to be a builder, to create or contribute to a product or service that improve people's life. It is essential that Technology should always focus on helping people solving their problem, and try to help as many people as possible by making our product and services as widely avialable as possible.
