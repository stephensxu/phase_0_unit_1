My Website url: http://stephensxu.github.io/

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
- A: During the design process, I have spent a lot of time tinkering with CSS contents. I have realized that in order to catch user's attention, it is essential to design a web page that is simple and easy to read, understand. I feel that that less text, the better. In my opinion, user experience is essential to the success of a website.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
- A: Yes I do. The best part about being able to design front-end contents is that I have fully control of my user-experience. From the viewing, clicking, hovering, background down the the very small details. User experience is a dedicate design job, it requires extremely attention to details, down to every pixel. Being able to control user experience is enpowering developer to control how their product interact with customer. It is very important.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
- A: I first wireframed the site, and then started to design according to my wireframing process. I found that the wireframing process is extremely useful, because it always gives me a sketch to use as a reference when I'm lost in my development process.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
- A: The site is still incomplete at this stage; my background image is in low resolution so it doesn't look good; I need to continue work on refining the front-page.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
- A: The most difficult part for me is the configure the details of my CSS file. I'd like my readers to have the best possible viewing experience, so for every element down to the spacing in text I have used extra attention.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
