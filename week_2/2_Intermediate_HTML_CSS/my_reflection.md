# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
- It's difficult to make a good/bad judgment on the current web standards; but comparing the current HTML5 with old HTML standard, it definitly had great improvments. However I do believe the standard is something that has to be constantly changing in order to adapt the most current technology.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
- Yes the standard structure make sense to me. The most important reason to have a standard is that to ensure all the different browsers, developers and users have common understanding on how the general structure should be for their web product; it is essential to have such standard in order to help user have consistent experiences on the web and for developers to communicate with each-other. 

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
- Yes, I do like them. These new elements makes it possible that semantics carry logical structure; these semantics replace the usual "Div" which can easly plague the entire HTML file.

* Why is reset.css necessary? 
- reset.css is necessary to force the styling of the file to be uniformal across different browsers, because every browser started with different default style setting.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
- I have used IE, Chrome and Safari. I have definitely noticed that sites looked different in different browsers. I think it's very bad that they appear different, offering inconsistent user experiences.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
- This answer in stackoverflow helped me understand the main difference between HTML4 and HTML5.
