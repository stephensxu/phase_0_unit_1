# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

- The Document Object Model is a convention, or set of API that is used for representing and interacting with objecs in HTML and XML. It provides a structured representation of the documents as a group of nodes. It defines the structure of documents and allow user to manupulate these objects. It makes sense to me after I've learned with google dev tools how to manipulate different elements. The DOM is designed so user have flexibility in changing and studying different design style and structure of their web product.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

- My site is much simpler, the styles have much less function and variety, and my site does not include any javascript; while the site in world-press is much more complex in their structure, have more styles in css file, and include many scripts. 

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

- I found Chrome Web Tools one of the most useful tool I've learned so far, because it allow me to see the behind structure, the actual coding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript for many of my favorite webpages, allowing me to learn from these live examples; it also allow me to change styles for different webpages and experiment with live contents. It is extremely useful learning tool.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

- Throughout the entire learning process I have these "aha" moments, as I am finally able to see behind the scene how each website works, how HTML, CSS and JS files work together to present us the webpage, and realized how complex it is behind the scene to produce a good quality webiste that we see.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

- One good resource to help understanding chrome devtools is the tutorial from google themself at (https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/authoring-development-workflow)
