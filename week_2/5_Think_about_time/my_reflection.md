# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
- A: The biggest time management for me was that there were so many different task, and I was unable to determine which task would take more time and which task would take less. It was difficult to divide up my time between different chuncks to accompish each task individually. I would set time goal for myself, only to find that I have failed to accomplish the task before my own self-imposed deadline, and it was frustrating because I could not manage my time effectively.

* How will you combat that? 
- A: Now after I have became familiar with HTML and CSS, I have a better idea and estimation of how long a task would likely to take. I have to imporve two aspects: Better estimation of the time it takes to accomplish a task, and be more efficient at accomplishing that task. During the focus time, get less distracted and be more focused.

* What techniques will you try?
- A: I am starting to experiment with meditation in order to become more focused and effective during my study. I also started to do Yoga class every sunday in order to help me release stress and "reset" my mind and body.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
- A: My overall plan is to accomplish all the required reading, all the required task and get myself ready for the on-site training at DBC SF. I will be technically, mentally and physically ready to embrace the intensive learning challenge at DBC.
