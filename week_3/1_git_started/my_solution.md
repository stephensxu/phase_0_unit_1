## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add
<!-- Your defnition here -->
A: Add/stages file to git, in other words it allows git to track these files.

#### branch
A: This command create a seperate branch from the master; allowing user to make modificatin to files while keeping the master branch intact. 


#### checkout
A: This function allow user to move to different branch of repo. Basically it allow user to move to a different branch of the git "tree"; allowing user to jump between different branches.
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### clone
A: This function makes a copy of a certain repo and create an exact same one. Usually used to clone repo from an upstream such as GitHub to user's desktop. Or it can be used to clone someone's repo to user's own repo.
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### commit
A: This function records and saves the changes to the repo. It records the change between last commit and current version, and create a new commit point.
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### fetch
A: This function downloads the remote repo into user's local repo without merging the changes; this function allows user to keep both local version and remote version on their computer and manually make the merge as they see fit.
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### log
A: This function shows the commit history of the repo.
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### merge
A: This function merges two different branches, combining the modification made on both version. 
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### pull
A: This function combines "fetch" and "merge"; it downloads the repo from upstream and automatically merges with user's local repo.
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### push
A: This function sends the local version of the repo to the remote version and merges them at remote.
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### reset
A: This function allows user to move current branch to a different commit; which means it will point the current branch and HEAD to a different position in the working tree, allowing user to go back to the previous version of repo, before some bad changes were made. In simple words, it allow user to "rewrite history".
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### rm
A: This command removes files from the index and working tree. A removed file will no longer be tracked by Git.
<!-- Your defnition here -->

#### status
A: This command allows user to see the current commit status of a repo; it will tell the user if there is any untracked files, if there is any changes been made since last commit, and if the latest changes were committed.


## Release 4: Git Workflow

- Push files to a remote repository
- Fetch changes
- Commit locally

## Release 5: Errors you encountered
1. Error
2. Solution
3. Cause (explain the error)

A: I mostly understand the materials and did not encounter any unresolved error so far in my use.

## Release 6: Reflection

A: During the pre-phase 0 I have spent a lot of time trying to learn and understand how git works. First I found just by reading tutorials is difficult to fully grasp the concept, but late on as I forced myself to use Git for several times and going through a visual training tutorial, I have gained much better understanding of how Git work with Github. I think Git is one of the most useful tool in the software development process, because it allows user to freely make changes without worrying about making bad change and unable to revert back to previous version. This is a great tool for programmers to minimize the damage of human error during the development process.
